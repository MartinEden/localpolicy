Hey Martin. This code belongs to you. I saw on a post in StackOverflow that you lost it from Bitbucket and you did not have a backup.

Well, I was cleaning my "Downloads" folder on my machine and found it. I had downloaded it long time ago before it was deleted from Bitbucket. 

I could not find a way to contact you to let you know so you can publish it again under your name. 

Please let me know your email and I will send it to you.
